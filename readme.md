# Integrated AI Platform Business Plan 2.0

> Idea

- Platform that offers a secure access to LLMs and AI models, manages data, and automates processes for enterprise clients.

> Features

- Provides secure way for employees to use LLM without the risk of exposing sensitive data to the outside world.
- Provides a centralized database for LLM to securely access company data for Q&A and automation purposes.
- Provides a prompt to process automation workflow that can easily automate processes within an enterprise, such as repetitive office work, Q&A, data analysis tasks, and certain engineering tasks.
- The process automation can be saved for repetitive usage in the future.
- The users have full ownership of the data that goes in and out of the platform.

> Secure Access

- The users will be able to choose the LLM model that they are interacting with, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4, as well as most advanced open-source LLM models.
- All the data coming into the open-source LLM models will only be accessible by the users themselves.

> Process Automation

The workflow of creating process automation will work as following:
1. The user provides a prompt with some process to be automated, as well as relevant data.
2. Based on the user's prompt, the LLM will select the list of subtasks required for the given process.
3. The LLM will generate necessary code to execute each subtask, and include any AI models or APIs required for the subtask.
5. The process can be saved for future usage, where the process can be either triggered by events to fully automate a process, or ran multiple times at user's request.

> Secure Data Storage

- The users have access to all the input, conversation, and output logs on the platform, as well as being able to remove them as needed.
- The LLM can reference these data to enhance its accuracy.
- The admins of the enterprise will also be able to control the accessibility level of the data within the organization.

> Benefits

- **Security**: Enterprises can safely use LLM and other AI tools without the need to worry about exposing sensitive data to the outside world.
- **Automation**: With much easier way to automate processes within an enterprise, as well as access to hundreds of different AI models and APIs, enterprises can automate much of their work that are currently done by human employees, which can save significant amount of money.
- **Speed**: Because code can execute a task much faster than a human can, by automating large portion of the enterprise's work, the enterprise can get work done significantly faster.
- **Accuracy**: With secure access to enterprise data, LLM can produce much more accurate answers that is tailored towards the needs of the enterprise.
